# NY-Taxi-Challenge
A project based on the Kraggle data challenge "New York City Taxi Trip Duration." The challenge is to build a prediction model for ride duration for taxi trips in New York City. Also included is a simple data analysis aimed towards learning about ride frequency and duration based on time of day, day of week, and weather. 

taxiRides.py  defines a “taxiRide” class with attributes for cleaning taxi ride data (must be in competition-specified format), plotting various mass density functions and time series defining the  taxi ride data, and fitting a gradient-boosted tree to the data for ride duration predictions. 

Project bullet points are contained with the Latex files in the “Latex” folder. 

This project is ongoing.
